# DEFINITION :
Given function f and g the composite of f with g is denoted by fog is the function defined by fog(x)=f(g(x)).

## EXAMPLEs :
1. f(x)=x^2-1 and g(x)=2x+1
   
 *  fog(x)=f(2x+1)
   
   = 4x^2+4x
   
   = 4x(x-1)
 *  gof(x)=g(x^2-1)
   
   = 2x^2-2+1
   
   = 2x^2-1
   
 * fof(x)=f(f(x))
   
   = x^4-2x^2
   
   = x^2(x^2-2)  

2. A stone is dropped into a lake creating a circular ripple that travels outward at a speed of 60cm/sec.
   
   a) Express the rad r of this circle as a function of time t in secs.
   
   b) if a is the area of this circle as a function of the radius find composite of aor.
   
   ans-  speed = dist/time
   
          60t=r
          aor= a(r(t))
            =pie((60t))^2
            =3600piet^2
