# DEFINATION OF FUNCTION : 
It is a correspondance between a first set called the domain and second set called the range such that each member of domain corresponds to exactly one member of range.
## REPRESENTATION  OF FUNCTION :
1. VERBALLY : By description of words 
2. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION : If a graph is given we can find the function of the graph.
3. NUMERICALLY : By adding table values
4. ALGEBRICALLY : By adding an explicit formula.
# DOMAIN AND RANGE
## 1.DOMAIN :
It is the set of all possible input values( independent variable ) for which the function is defined.
## 2.RANGE :
It is the set of all poosible output values( dependent variable ) that the function can be produced.
## EXAMPLES :
