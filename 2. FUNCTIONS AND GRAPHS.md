# DEFINATION OF FUNCTION : 
It is a correspondance between a first set called the domain and second set called the range such that each member of domain corresponds to exactly one member of range.
## REPRESENTATION  OF FUNCTION :
1. VERBALLY : By description of words 
2. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION : If a graph is given we can find the function of the graph.
3. NUMERICALLY : By adding table values
4. ALGEBRICALLY : By adding an explicit formula.
# DOMAIN AND RANGE
## 1.DOMAIN :
It is the set of all possible input values( independent variable ) for which the function is defined.
## 2.RANGE :
It is the set of all poosible output values( dependent variable ) that the function can be produced.
## EXAMPLES :
1. y=3x-2
   
DOMAIN : ALL REAL NUMBERS
RANGE: (-infinty , +infinity )

2. y=x^2

DOMAIN: ALL REAL NUMBERS
RANGE: [0,+ INFINITY)

#EXAMPLES :

A box with an' opened top is to be consruted from a rectangular piece of carboard with dimensions 12inch/20inch by cutting out equal sqares of sides x and each corner and then folding upthe sides. Express the volume of the boxbas the function of x


-- height is x

length is 20-2x

breadth is 12-2x

Volume of rectangular box = lxbxh

            = x(20-2x)(12-2x)
            = 240x-40x^2-24x^2+4x^3
            = 4x^3 -64x^2 +240x
