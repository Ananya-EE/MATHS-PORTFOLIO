Functions and graphs teach us how to model and visualize relationships between variables. They allow us to analyze trends and behaviors, helping us understand how changes in one variable affect another. By representing data visually, graphs make it easier to identify patterns and make predictions.
Overall, these concepts are essential for interpreting and solving real-world problems
Functions and graphs provide a powerful way to understand and represent relationships between variables. Functions describe how one quantity depends on another, while graphs visually illustrate these relationships, allowing us to see trends, patterns, and behaviors at a glance. By analyzing a graph, we can identify key features like maxima, minima, and points of intersection, which helps in predicting outcomes and making informed decisions. This understanding is crucial across various fields, including science, economics, and engineering, as it enhances our ability to interpret data and solve real-world problems effectively.

Limits and derivatives are foundational concepts in calculus that help us understand change and behavior in mathematical functions. 

Limits allow us to analyze the behavior of a function as it approaches a specific point, helping us understand continuity and the values functions approach. Derivatives, on the other hand, represent the rate of change of a function; they tell us how a function is changing at any given point. 

Together, these concepts enable us to solve problems involving motion, optimize functions, and model real-world scenarios where change occurs. They provide tools for analyzing complex systems and understanding dynamic behavior in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and economics.
