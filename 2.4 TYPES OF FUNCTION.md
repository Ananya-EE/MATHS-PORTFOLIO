### 1.Linear Functions (e.g., y=mx+by = mx + by=mx+b):

Graphs are straight lines.

They represent constant rates of change.

### 2.Quadratic Functions (e.g., y=x2y = x^2y=x2):

Graphs are U-shaped curves called parabolas.

They can model things like the path of a thrown ball.

### 3.Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:

Exponential graphs (e.g., y=2xy = 2^xy=2x) grow rapidly and can model population growth.

Logarithmic graphs (e.g., y=log⁡(x)y = \log(x)y=log(x)) grow slowly and are the inverse of exponential functions.

### 4.Trigonometric Functions (e.g., y=sin⁡(x)y = \sin(x)y=sin(x), y=cos⁡(x)y = \cos(x)y=cos(x)):

These functions produce wave-like graphs and are periodic, meaning they repeat in cycles.

They model phenomena like sound waves and light waves.
