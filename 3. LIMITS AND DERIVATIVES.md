# DEFINATION
Here the function tends to zero and it isnt equal to zero.we get a very small value so we ignore it and it tends to zero.

Consider a wire of 1m long and cut the wire into two equal pieces. Then, by taking 1 of those pieces, cut into half again. Continue this process each time, cutting the remaining piece of fire can be described by:-

Original length = 1m

After 1st cut = 1/2 m

After 2nd cut = 1/4 m

After 3rd cut = 1/6 m

After 4th cut = 1/8 m

Therefore Ln = 1/2n 

As we continue cutting the wire into half indefinitely, the length of the remaining piece will get closer and closer to zero, but it will never actual 0. 
Mathematically we write as limit(n→∞), 1/2n = 0. Means as n→∞, the value of 1/2n appears to 0.

# HORIZONTAL ASYMPTOTE
Mathematically we define as the line y=L of the curve y=f(x) is either lim(x→∞) f(x)=L.

# VERTICAL ASYMPTOTE
The line x=a of the curve y=f(x) if lim(x-a) f(x)= ∞.

# DERIVATIVE AND RATE OF CHANGE
The derivative of a function at a is denoted by f'(a)

f'(a)=lim(h-0) f(a+h) - f(a)/h if limit exists.
